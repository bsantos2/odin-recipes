		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>1 cup of chocolate chips</li>
			<li>8 tbsps of unsalted butter</li>
			<li>3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
			<li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
			<li>2 tsps of espresso powder</li>
			<li>1 tsp of King Arthur's Vanilla Extract</li>
			<li>3 large eggs</li>
			<li>1/2 cup of cocoa powder</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a metal 8" round cake pan; cut a piece of parchment to fit, grease it, and lay it in the bottom of the pan. See "tips," below.
			</li>
			<li>
				To make the cake: Put the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and heat until the butter is melted and the chips are soft. Stir until the chips melt, reheating briefly if necessary. You can also do this over a burner set at very low heat. Transfer the melted chocolate/butter to a mixing bowl.
			</li>
			<li>
				Stir in the sugar, salt, espresso powder, and vanilla. Espresso enhances chocolate's flavor much as vanilla does; using 1 teaspoon will simply enhance the flavor, while 2 teaspoons will lend a hint of mocha to the cake.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add the eggs, beating briefly until smooth. Add the cocoa powder, and mix just to combine.
			</li>
		</ol>
